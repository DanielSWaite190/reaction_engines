Project Ideas:
1. Use the same inventory app database and redo the last project. (There are things I wanted to add to it)
2. Rocket Engine Api project (inventory of rocket engines, there details, and the rockets/missions they have flown on)
3. Twiter Clone
4. Todo List

REACTION ENGINE API
In this project one of my main goals was to compartmentalize each react component, writing it in such a way that I could reuse it for different parts of my site. The best example of this is the form component. My site has two places where information is being handled by a form, one to create a new engine and another to edit them. The last time I wrote an app like this I simply wrote two different forms to handle adding to the database and updating the information that was already there. This time I used props to pass in the specific functionality to the component depending on what it was being used for. 

Another big part of this project for me was styling. I decided to use a CSS framework instead of just regular css. I played around with bootstrap until my site had a little more personality and then I decided to give it a second theme for dark mode.
